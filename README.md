# Grit

Grit treats the Issues and native Dependencies in one GitHub Repository as a
graph. GitHub remains the source of truth; Grit keeps a disposable Local
replica so later analysis can be fast and work offline.

The current executable tracer implements full synchronization and Executable
frontier enumeration from
[Issue #2](https://github.com/syntropika/grit/issues/2) and
[Issue #3](https://github.com/syntropika/grit/issues/3), plus canonical
Declared priority support from
[Issue #6](https://github.com/syntropika/grit/issues/6).

## Build and test

Grit requires a stable Rust toolchain with Edition 2024 support.

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

## Synchronize a Repository

Grit first tries the token from the active `gh` session and falls back to a
non-empty `GH_TOKEN`:

```bash
grit sync --repo OWNER/REPO
grit sync --repo OWNER/REPO --json
```

`--json` emits the versioned `grit.sync/v1` result envelope with Repository
scope, `synced_at`, a deterministic input hash, and normalized entity counts.
Neither output mode includes credentials or raw GitHub responses.

The Local replica uses the operating system's application-data directory.
Set `GRIT_STATE_DIR` to isolate it, for example in CI. `GRIT_GITHUB_API_URL`
and `GRIT_GITHUB_HOST` support GitHub Enterprise and deterministic test
servers; the API URL must be a credential-free HTTP(S) base URL.

A synchronization retrieves every page of Issues and Repository Issue
comments, then the native `blocked_by` Dependencies for each Issue. Pull
Requests returned by the Issues endpoint are excluded. Grit writes only a
normalized model and atomically replaces the previous valid replica after the
entire load succeeds.

The replica file format and location below `GRIT_STATE_DIR` are implementation
details. Consumers should use Grit's versioned command output rather than read
the replica directly.

## Initialize Declared priority

Grit v1 reads Declared priority only from `priority:p0` through `priority:p4`
labels. Initialize missing labels explicitly:

```bash
grit init --repo OWNER/REPO
grit init --repo OWNER/REPO --json
```

Initialization creates only missing canonical names. It never renames,
recolors, redescribes, deletes, or assigns an existing label, so repeated runs
converge without further changes. Read commands never create labels.

## Enumerate Executable work

`grit ready` refreshes the Local replica and lists the complete Executable
frontier in ascending Issue-number order:

```bash
grit ready --repo OWNER/REPO
grit ready --repo OWNER/REPO --assignee LOGIN --json
```

Without `--assignee`, the Execution scope contains Ready unassigned Issues.
With it, the scope contains Ready Issues assigned to that login. Assignment is
reported separately from Dependency readiness. JSON reports every returned
Issue's priority as `declared`, `unspecified`, or `conflict`. A conflict remains
eligible and does not change readiness; it compares as neutral in later ranking
commands. Missing canonical Repository labels and conflicts appear as warnings.

If GitHub cannot be reached, `ready` uses the latest valid Local replica and
reports its unchanged `synced_at`. A replica is accepted only when its schema,
Repository scope, timestamp, and deterministic content hash validate. If no
valid replica exists, the command fails instead of inventing an empty graph.

## Product decisions

The canonical domain language and accepted decisions live in
[`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) and [`docs/adr`](docs/adr). The normative ranking
contract is [`docs/design/ranking-next-v1.md`](docs/design/ranking-next-v1.md).

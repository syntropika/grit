# Grit

Grit treats the Issues and native Dependencies in one GitHub Repository as a
graph. GitHub remains the source of truth; Grit keeps a disposable Local
replica so later analysis can be fast and work offline.

Grit supports full and incremental synchronization, Dependency-event continuity,
Executable frontier enumeration, canonical Declared priority initialization,
native Dependency mutations, Declared priority updates, and deterministic
static graph artifacts, with actionable triage diagnostics and exact horizon-one
next-work recommendations. Its offline browser explorer presents the precomputed
Issue graph with synchronized network and accessible table selection.

## Build and test

Grit requires a stable Rust toolchain with Edition 2024 support.

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

The browser acceptance test is intentionally gated because the ordinary Rust
suite has no browser dependency. Run it explicitly with a Chrome-compatible
binary (Google Chrome by default):

```bash
GRIT_BROWSER=google-chrome cargo test --test graph_cli \
  generated_site_is_a_keyboard_accessible_offline_graph_explorer -- --ignored --exact
```

The test launches an ephemeral headless profile with background networking
disabled and host resolution denied.

## Synchronize a Repository

Grit first tries the token from the active `gh` session and falls back to a
non-empty `GH_TOKEN`:

```bash
grit sync --repo OWNER/REPO
grit sync --repo OWNER/REPO --json
```

`--json` emits the versioned `grit.sync/v1` result envelope with Repository
scope, `synced_at`, a deterministic input hash, and normalized entity counts.
Neither output mode includes credentials or raw GitHub responses.

The Local replica uses the operating system's application-data directory.
Set `GRIT_STATE_DIR` to isolate it, for example in CI. `GRIT_GITHUB_API_URL`
and `GRIT_GITHUB_HOST` support GitHub Enterprise and deterministic test
servers; the API URL must be a credential-free HTTP(S) base URL.

The first synchronization retrieves every page of Issues and Repository Issue
comments, then the native `blocked_by` Dependencies for each Issue. Pull
Requests returned by the Issues endpoint are excluded. Later runs request
ordinary Issue and comment changes from an overlapped `updated_at` watermark,
paginate them in stable creation order, upsert them by stable GitHub identity,
and refresh Dependencies only for Issues whose ordinary fields changed. A
scoped ETag is reused only when the preceding delta proved that the complete
representation fit in fewer than 100 items; it is never treated as a
Repository-wide continuity guarantee.

Dependency additions and removals use a separate Repository event checkpoint.
Grit canonicalizes the mirrored `blocked_by` and `blocking` events into one
edge direction and fetches any referenced in-scope Issue absent from the Local
replica. A one-request GraphQL count probe also detects Issues that disappeared
without a REST delta tombstone. If that count diverges, the checkpoint
disappears from the available event history, no event-ID anchor exists, an
event cannot be interpreted safely, or an Issue was transferred or deleted,
Grit discards the partial delta and performs a Full reconciliation before
publishing anything.

Grit writes only a normalized model and atomically replaces the previous valid
replica after every required page has completed. A failed or rate-limited delta
leaves the prior replica, internal watermark, and visible `synced_at` intact.

The replica file format and location below `GRIT_STATE_DIR` are implementation
details. Consumers should use Grit's versioned command output rather than read
the replica directly.

## Initialize Declared priority

Grit v1 reads Declared priority only from `priority:p0` through `priority:p4`
labels. Initialize missing labels explicitly:

```bash
grit init --repo OWNER/REPO
grit init --repo OWNER/REPO --json
```

Initialization creates only missing canonical names. It never renames,
recolors, redescribes, deletes, or assigns an existing label, so repeated runs
converge without further changes. Read commands never create labels.

Update one Issue's logical Priority online with a full Issue reference:

```bash
grit update OWNER/REPO#NUMBER --priority p0
grit update OWNER/REPO#NUMBER --priority none --json
```

A concrete value removes every other canonical Priority label and leaves
exactly the requested one; `none` removes all canonical Priority labels. Grit
preserves non-Priority labels and every other Issue field. It writes GitHub
first, then synchronizes and verifies the logical result before publishing the
Local replica. The output reports both the previous and resulting Priority.

## Enumerate Executable work

`grit ready` refreshes the Local replica and lists the complete Executable
frontier in ascending Issue-number order:

```bash
grit ready --repo OWNER/REPO
grit ready --repo OWNER/REPO --assignee LOGIN --json
```

Without `--assignee`, the Execution scope contains Ready unassigned Issues.
With it, the scope contains Ready Issues assigned to that login. Assignment is
reported separately from Dependency readiness. JSON reports every returned
Issue's priority as `declared`, `unspecified`, or `conflict`. A conflict remains
eligible and does not change readiness; it compares as neutral in later ranking
commands. Missing canonical Repository labels and conflicts appear as warnings.

If GitHub cannot be reached, `ready` uses the latest valid Local replica and
reports its unchanged `synced_at`. A replica is accepted only when its schema,
Repository scope, timestamp, and deterministic content hash validate. If no
valid replica exists, the command fails instead of inventing an empty graph.

## Recommend the next Issue

`grit next` evaluates every Issue in the active Executable frontier exactly at
horizon one:

```bash
grit next --repo OWNER/REPO --horizon 1
grit next --repo OWNER/REPO --assignee LOGIN --horizon 1 --json
```

The `next/v1` policy first enforces Executable P0 and one-step P0-route gates.
It then compares real AND-aware Unlock sets, downstream Priority composition,
the first step's Declared priority, a quantized PageRank tie-break, and finally
the Stable node key. It never recommends blocked or out-of-scope work.

Robot output reports both snapshot and effective-input hashes, metric states,
the global runner-up comparison, structured reasons, and whether the result is
a close structural tie. If no Issue is Executable, the command succeeds with a
null recommendation and categorized blocker counts. Like `ready`, it attempts
a pull Synchronization and falls back to the latest valid Local replica without
mutating GitHub.

## Triage graph problems

`grit triage` explains actionable graph problems without treating blocked work
as executable:

```bash
grit triage --repo OWNER/REPO
grit triage --repo OWNER/REPO --assignee LOGIN --json
```

Diagnostics cover blocked P0 Issues, open or unknown External blockers, cyclic
SCCs, assigned Ready work, and Priority conflicts. Each subject reports
Dependency readiness, availability, and membership in the active Execution
scope separately. Closed historical topology produces no diagnostic. Output is
deterministic and uses stable reason codes and Issue references.

Like other analysis commands, `triage` attempts only pull Synchronization. If
GitHub is unavailable, it uses the latest valid Local replica and reports the
unchanged `synced_at`.

## Change native Dependencies

Use full Issue references so the direction remains explicit:

```bash
grit block OWNER/REPO#42 --by OWNER/REPO#7
grit unblock OWNER/REPO#42 --by OWNER/REPO#7 --json
```

The first command means “Issue #42 is blocked by Issue #7.” Grit writes the
native GitHub `blocked_by` relationship, then performs a complete synchronized
readback before atomically replacing the Local replica. Repeating either
operation uses set semantics: an existing edge can be added again and an absent
edge can be removed again without error. If the write outcome or readback is
uncertain, the previous Local replica remains unchanged.

## Generate a static graph artifact

`grit graph` writes a complete static site without a live service or
browser-side GitHub client:

```bash
grit graph --repo OWNER/REPO --output site/
grit graph --repo OWNER/REPO --output site/ --json
```

The target contains `index.html`, `app.css`, `app.js`, `graph.json`, and
`graph.schema.json`. The versioned JSON uses explicit `blocked` and `blocker`
edge roles, normalized Issue fields, precomputed layered positions,
operational counts, hashes, and provenance. Bodies, comments, raw API records,
and Operation markers are not part of the artifact.

The browser explorer searches by Issue number or title, renders the precomputed
dependency layers, and keeps graph selection synchronized with an accessible
Issue table. Its detail panel shows readiness, blockers, dependents, and the
canonical GitHub link. Labels appear only on hover, focus, or selection, and
the zoom controls never recalculate layout or ranking. All assets are local;
the browser does not contact GitHub or any other network service.

Generation validates the closed artifact model in a staging directory before
replacing the target. Regenerating from the same effective Local replica is
byte-stable. `synced_at` is the only time field and changes only when the input
replica itself has a different synchronization timestamp.

## Product decisions

The canonical domain language and accepted decisions live in
[`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) and [`docs/adr`](docs/adr). The normative ranking
contract is [`docs/design/ranking-next-v1.md`](docs/design/ranking-next-v1.md).
